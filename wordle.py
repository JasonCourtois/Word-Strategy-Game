    Check Input Logic
    Check user input by first looping over the guess once checking for any characters in the
    correct position. If something is in the correct position, set its color to green (3), and decrease
    the frequency by 1. Loop through the guess a second time looking for characters in the wrong
    position. Only mark it as yellow (2) if it isn't already green, the letter is actually in the answer, and
    there is still remaining uses of this letter in letter_frequency. Lastly, if a letter is unused
    set its keyboard color to grey if and only if the keyboard color hasn't already been set to green or yellow.
    Returns 2 if the word was guessed.
    Returns 1 if all guesses were used.
    Returns 0 if word wasn't guessed and there are guesses remaining.
